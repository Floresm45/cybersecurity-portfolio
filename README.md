## 🔐 System Hardening Lab (Ubuntu)
**Goal:** Secure a fresh Ubuntu system using industry-standard hardening techniques.

- ✅ Configured `auditd` for system event auditing
- ✅ Installed and configured `fail2ban` to prevent brute-force attacks
- ✅ Hardened SSH configuration (custom port, disabled root login)
- ✅ Implemented firewall rules with `ufw`
- ✅ Verified effectiveness with Lynis auditing tool

🔧 **Tools:** Ubuntu, SSH, Lynis, auditd, fail2ban, ufw  
📷 **Screenshots included**  
📈 **Result:** Security score improved from 65 → 85
