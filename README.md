# Cybersecurity Portfolio – Manny Flores

Hi, I’m Manny Flores — a cybersecurity professional building hands-on projects to showcase my technical and analytical skills. 
Below are real-world simulations I've completed covering threat detection, system hardening, and more.

## Projects

### 🔍 [Phishing Investigation](phishing-investigation/)
Simulated a phishing attack, used Splunk to analyze log data, and created a report with mitigation strategies.

### 🛡️ [System Hardening Lab](system-hardening-lab/)
Secured a vulnerable Ubuntu VM by applying CIS-based security configurations and comparing pre-/post-hardening scores.
