# 🕵️ Phishing Incident Investigation

## 📋 Project Overview
Simulated a phishing attack and used Splunk to identify indicators of compromise (IoCs), trace attack behavior, and recommend mitigations.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Splunk (free cloud trial)
- Sample phishing logs
- Regex, dashboards, log analysis

---

## 🔍 Investigation Process
1. **Ingested Logs** – Uploaded email server logs into Splunk
2. **Identified Suspicious Activity** – Used queries to detect phishing URLs, attachments, and user activity
3. **Mapped the Attack Chain** – Traced timeline from phishing email to user click
4. **Recommendations** – Proposed 2FA, improved email filtering, security awareness training

---

## ✅ Key Findings
- Majority of phishing attempts targeted `employee@company.com`
- High-risk attachments like `invoice.pdf` and fake URLs were present
- Attackers often used `Update` and `Alert` in subject lines

---

## 📌 Recommendations
- Improve phishing training and reporting protocol
- Flag senders with repeat high-risk activity
- Block known malicious domains and file types
