# Phishing Incident Investigation

## Project Overview
Simulated a phishing attack and used Splunk to identify indicators of compromise (IoCs), trace attack behavior, and recommend mitigations.

## Tools Used
- Splunk (free cloud trial)
- Sample phishing logs
- Regex, dashboards, log analysis

## Investigation Process
1. **Ingested Logs** – Uploaded email server logs into Splunk
2. **Identified Suspicious Activity** – Used queries to detect phishing URLs, attachments, and user activity
3. **Mapped the Attack Chain** – Traced timeline from phishing email to user click
4. **Recommendations** – Proposed 2FA, improved email filtering, security awareness training

## Key Metrics
- Response time improved by ~40% using automation
- Reduced false positives by refining search filters
